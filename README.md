# Hi-Tek AIM-65

The keboard assembly that came with a Rockwell AIM-65 microcomputer [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM-65)

I fitted a Pro Micro with [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) on the original connector to make it work on a modern computer.
I also designed a custom 3D-printable case for it (WIP).
